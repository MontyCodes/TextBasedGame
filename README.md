# TextBasedGame
This is a text based game I created during my Introduction to Scripting Class
Storyboard (Description and Map)
The legendary vampire Shalltear Blood fallen has taken over your Chateau. She has challenged you to a duel in the main chamber to win the rights to your castle back. You have until midnight, or it will be automatic forfeit. Before you’re able to fight her, you will need to acquire legendary items of Yggdrasil to increase your combat power. These legendary items will be “The Book of dead” from the Study in order to learn her weak spots, Guardian armor from the Bedroom in order to withstand her onslaught of attacks,  Apollo’s helmet from the Crypt to enhance your vision, The Ethereal Axe from the Coop in order to cut her down, The Aegis Sheild from the exhibit in order to defend from her blood attacks and also a Golden apple (Gapple for short) from Kitchen to give you regeneration.
